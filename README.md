Accessibility Lab Answers

For this lab I went through the site and fixed a bunch of issues that made it hard to use. I updated the color scheme since the original green background and dark text failed contrast checks, switching it to black text on a white background so it’s actually readable. I also restructured the content using proper headings and paragraphs, and turned the nav bar into a real <nav> element so keyboard navigation and screen readers work the way they should. Images now have descriptive alt text, and the audio file includes a transcript with download links so both deaf users and people on older browsers can still access it.

I fixed the forms by adding proper labels (including a hidden label on the search bar) so they’re announced correctly, and I rewired the show/hide comments button so it’s fully keyboard accessible with ARIA attributes. The table was also updated with a caption, headers, and scope attributes so rows and columns can be understood with assistive tech. On top of that I added focus outlines and cleaned up the heading structure to make the page easier to navigate overall.
